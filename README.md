## Handwrite recognize

This is a course project at the University of Hamburg, aiming to implement the classification of handwritten digits (0-9) using AI tools, based on linear and nonlinear models. 

The core learning objectives are: 
1. Fundamental concepts of software development,
2. Neural networks
3. Gradient methods
4. Optimization methods
5. Methods to improve model performance
